## üìö How It Works

The application connects to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges via WebSocket connections to receive real-time order book data. This data is then aggregated, processed, and displayed in a unified interface.

Key components:
1. **Exchange Connectors**: Handle WebSocket connections to each exchange
2. **Data Aggregation**: Combines order book data from all sources
3. **UI Rendering**: Displays the aggregated data in a user-friendly format
